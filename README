Test-Reporter-Transport-Outlook

If you want to test Perl modules for CPAN but is located in a very restricted environment, without HTTP or SMTP access
outside the network and can count only with an Outlook and Exchange server to send emails, this module is for you.

This module will use C<Win32::OLE> module with MS Outlook to create a new email message. This message will contain
all information regarding the test report and I<would> be ready to be sent I<if> new security patches of Outlook 
didn't forbid that.

As an alternative, the message can be saved on the "Drafts" (or whatever is called in your computer) or can be displayed
so you will only need to click (or review before clicking) the report. Default behavior is to save the email so you can
avoid having lot's of new email messages being opened if you're testing real hard new distributions.
